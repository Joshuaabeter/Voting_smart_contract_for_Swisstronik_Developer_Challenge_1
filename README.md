# Voting_smart_contract_for_Swisstronik_Developer_Challenge_1 - Hackathon

### Developer Challenge:

Develop a basic smart contract for a voting system that allows only registered members to vote and deploy it on Swisstronik testnet.

### Requirements:
Ensure that all state variables are private 

Create a smart contract for the voting system 

Implement a function for the contract owner to register new voters

Allow only the contract owner to add new voters

Create a modifier (e.g. onlyVoter) or a function to check that only registered voters can interact with the contract. Apply this check to all voting-related functions

Develop functions for registered voters to cast their votes

Create a function to retrieve the current vote count

### Moving Forward
I will attempt to test and deploy the contract to Swisstronik testnet.
